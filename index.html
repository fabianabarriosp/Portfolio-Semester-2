                        <p class="about-txt">This project is to showcase the work I've done throughout the semester like my technical skills, such as web development, brand design and multimedia content creation. It's used to document the projects I've worked on like Branding theater Blik, Media Campaign for Monk, Project X and allows me to track my progress over time.</p>

                        <p class="designChoices-txt1">I started creating this idea I had envisioned on 
                            <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/EM8N5AAlutdnZpN8nnbxMD/portfolio?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=VPHChLZ2obl9WDri-0">Figma.</a>
                            I made different designs, one more journal looking and another one with a magazine style which I thought gave an elegant touch to the project.</p>
                        <p class="designChoices-txt2">I used a picture showing me from the front angle (cover page) and the same one from a back angle (end page) to mark the front and back of the diary. I specifically chose the same picture with different angles to symbolize the journey and progression throughout the different projects, beginning with the front-face image that introduces me and my work and concluding with the back-face image.</p>

It helped me show my skills, reflect on my progress along the semester, and understand how to present my work in a professional, creative way. It taught me how to organize information in an effective way and a key step in understanding the importance of storytelling and visual presentation in my career. </p>

                          <p class="about-txtblik">We were assigned to re-brand Theater Blik, four women aiming to expand their little improv group in Amersfoort into an association of actors and musicians. Our mission was to create a brand identity for the Blik group that fits their goals and personality. Additionally, provide useful tips on how to update different social media platforms to promote their work around The Netherlands.</p>

Because the Blik ladies wanted a playful style for their brand I came up with the squiggly lines that represent an abstract path, because Blik is an improvisation theater group, the audience (and even the actors themselves) never know where theyÂ´re heading. The squiggly lines are undefined and do not cross but eventually connect when its needed, just like people.</p>
