                        <p class="about-txt">This project is to showcase the work I've done throughout the semester like my technical skills, such as web development, brand design and multimedia content creation. It's used to document the projects I've worked on like Branding theater Blik, Media Campaign for Monk, Project X and allows me to track my progress over time.</p>

                        <p class="designChoices-txt1">I started creating this idea I had envisioned on 
                            <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/EM8N5AAlutdnZpN8nnbxMD/portfolio?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=VPHChLZ2obl9WDri-0">Figma.</a>
                            I made different designs, one more journal looking and another one with a magazine style which I thought gave an elegant touch to the project.</p>
                        <p class="designChoices-txt2">I used a picture showing me from the front angle (cover page) and the same one from a back angle (end page) to mark the front and back of the diary. I specifically chose the same picture with different angles to symbolize the journey and progression throughout the different projects, beginning with the front-face image that introduces me and my work and concluding with the back-face image.</p>

At first i was planning on creating an index page but soon realized it was not ideal as the user would have to scroll through all the pages and cannot easily access a specific section.</p>

                    <h2>Design Tools</h2><br>
                    <p class="designTools-txt">I used tools like Affinity Design, Figma and Pinterest to create my portfolio. Pinterest to help me gather my ideas which I later envisioned in AD and created a prototype in Figma.</p>

                        <p class="reflection-txt">Creating a portfolio was essential for my learning. It helped me show my skills, reflect on my progress along the semester, and understand how to present my work in a professional, creative way. It taught me how to organize information in an effective way and a key step in understanding the importance of storytelling and visual presentation in my career. </p>

                          <p>We were assigned to re-brand Theater Blik, four women aiming to expand their little improv group in Amersfoort into an association of actors and musicians. Our mission was to create a brand identity for the Blik group that fits their goals and personality. Additionally, provide useful tips on how to update different social media platforms to promote their work around The Netherlands.</p>

                          <h2>Moodboard</h2><br>
                          <p>I gathered images from Pinterest and created a mood-board to conceptualize the overall vibe of the brand. I combined images, text and symbols for this.</p>
                          <h2>Stylescape</h2><br>
                          <p>Before getting feedback from the client, i created a stylescape to give them a better concept of more concrete ideas by visualizing possible logos, typography & color palette.</p>
