                            I made different designs, one more journal looking and another one with a magazine style
                            which I thought gave an elegant touch to the project.

                        <p class="designChoices-txt2">I used a picture showing me from the front angle (cover page) and
                            the same one from a back angle (end page) to mark the front and back of the diary. I
                            specifically chose the same picture with different angles to symbolize the journey and
                            progression throughout the different projects, beginning with the front-face image that
                            introduces me and my work and concluding with the back-face image.</p>

                            the pages was really cool, although navigation would be interesting to see what i would come
                            up with. At first i was planning on creating an index page but soon realized it was not
                            ideal as the user would have to scroll through all the pages and cannot easily access a
                            specific section.</p>

                            mission was to create a brand identity for the Blik group that fits their goals and
                            personality. Additionally, provide useful tips on how to update different social media

                        representatives I still played a role in creating the final deliverables. Because the Blik
                        ladies wanted a playful style for their brand I came up with the squiggly lines that represent
                        an abstract path, because Blik is an improvisation theater group, the audience (and even the
                        actors themselves) never know where they´re heading. The squiggly lines are undefined and do not
                        cross but eventually connect when its needed, just like people.</p>

                            <p class="Design3Monk-txt">Clients didn't enjoy the first designs so I used the same tagline but emphasizing “Your” in a colorful and playful way to simulate the colored rocks when practicing bouldering inside. Monk aims to have positive encouragement with its customers so the over-sized, colorful letters in "Your" immediately draw attention to the message that Monk’s products and expertise are focused on empowering the climber's personal journey (in bouldering and outside). Some people may not relate the letters with the holds, which come in different shapes, sizes, and colors to create routes with various difficulty levels and styles for climbers and that´s the reason I specifically chose this image for the background of the poster.</p>
